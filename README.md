# Multi-Modal-Machine-Learning
### From Classification to Clustering - An End-to-End Machine Learning Project on the Iris Flower Dataset

This project, presented in a Jupyter Notebook titled "A\_Multi\_Modal\_ML.ipynb", demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning workflow using the Iris Flower Dataset. It covers various machine learning techniques, including classification, clustering, and dimensionality reduction.

### Key Topics Covered:

  * **Classification:**
      * Logistic Regression
      * Random Forest (RF)
      * K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)
      * Support Vector Machine (SVM) - Linear
  * **Clustering:**
      * K-Means
  * **Dimensionality Reduction:**
      * Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

### Project Structure and Steps:

The notebook is organized into logical steps, guiding through the machine learning process:

1.  **Load and Explore the Data:** This section involves loading the Iris dataset and performing initial exploratory data analysis (EDA).
2.  **Data Visualization:** Various plots and visualizations are used to understand the relationships within the dataset and between features and species.
      * Pairplot of Iris Features by Species
      * Boxplots for each feature
3.  **Data Preprocessing:** This step prepares the data for model training, which may include scaling and splitting into training and testing sets.
4.  **Classification Models:** Implementation and evaluation of different classification algorithms on the Iris dataset.
5.  **Clustering with K-Means:** Application of K-Means clustering to group similar data points.
6.  **Dimensionality Reduction with PCA:** Using PCA to reduce the number of features while retaining important information.

### Libraries Used:

The project utilizes common Python libraries for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization:

  * `numpy`
  * `pandas`
  * `matplotlib.pyplot`
  * `seaborn`
  * `sklearn.datasets`
